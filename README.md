### Me
I'm Eymen, from Syrian, I use PC min 8 hours daily since I was 4 years old, I'm -proudly- the tech guy of my friends and family. I love boxing, muaythai and anything helps in real fights. I love running too, my only source of happiness after Quran. I'm also interested in Arabic litrature and human psychology, I'm just good at them with no effort. \
I also have a unique hobby, which is learning escaping techniques, breaking into locked stuff, surviving extremely harsh envirmoents, staying anonymous... etc, you can say, real-life hacking.

### Chess
I'm a 1655 ELO retired chess player. I retired from chess for many reasons, Chess is Haram! I discovered that chess is only a board game, doesn't improce focus and intellegence or anything it's also addictive, espeacially e-tournaments. I could do better things with the time I waste on chess.

### Education and academic life 
My story with education could be a very successful movie! like I'm Serious, it was horrible. From 1th grade to 7th, I always got %95+ total score. I looked like a dorky nerd, but I wasn't studying, I almost never studied, just memorise what teacher says and write them in the exam, boom full score. 8th to 11th grade, I went to turkish school, since my old technique doesn't work anymore because my turkish were so bad, I started studying very hard and started translating recording every single lesson I take then translate it to arabic... nah just kidding, I didn't study and barely passed to the high school with total score of %58. 

Just a fun story, when I entered "highschool entrance test", I didn't bother reading and solving question, just made shaped in the bubble sheet in the first section, and the second section remembered my new minecraft server that I created with my friends, I wrote 3 answers and exited the exam, but somehow I got 217/500. 

coming to highschool, I've studied in the wrost highschool, at least in my city. Everything you could imagine in a looser society is in this highschool: drugs, weed, sex for money in the toilets, same gender relationships. Bulliers were the good guys in the school, and me being an Arab (also half-nerdy) in between 600-700 Turkish dudes wasn't the best thing may happen. I couldn't even survive to the 12th grade, just converted to homeschool in the middle of 11th grade. (if the quarantine didn't exist, I think I wouldn't survive to the 10th grade).

while I'm 11th, I decided to run away from Turkey by studying in the USA, I studied for the SAT and I've got accepted in Tufts University, didn't travel to USA for some personal and governmental reasons

### Me, in numbers
SAT score: 1480 
Chess ELO (I'm retired): 1655 (rapid)
IQ: 148
